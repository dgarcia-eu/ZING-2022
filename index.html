## The effect of Twitter outages on user behavior 

### With Jana Lasser

- e.g: Twitter went offline for about 4 hours on July 14, 202
- Collecting tweets from before/after the shutdown and answer some exploratory research questions:
  - How long does it take until posting volume is back to usual levels? 
  - How much of a hit in engagement do tweets that were posted shortly before the shutdown get? 
  - Is there a reduction in toxicity for tweets or reactions to tweets shortly after the shutdown because people had more time to think about what they post during the shutdown?

## The German Telegramsphere 

### With Jana Lasser

Analysis of large data dump from the last two years of content from over 7000 mostly German-speaking Telegram channels - the "Schwurbelarchiv".

Exploration and descriptive analysis of the Telegram dataset, answering for example the following questions: 

- How many unique users are active in the different channels and how large is the overlap of users between channels? 
- How much content is text, images or videos? 
- At what times to users usually post in the channels? 

Note that this project will require some computational skills to access data on a remote server and deal with very large amounts of data (e.g. scripting)

## Network analysis of colexification 

### with David Garcia and Anna Di Natale

Analysis of networks connecting words through common translations, following our recent work studying affective meaning in this kind of networks (Di Natale, Pellert &amp; Garcia, 2021). 

This analysis can focus on various topics, such as the topological structure of the network (e.g. communities, comparison with other word networks), cultural aspects when including word ratings, and gender biases that generate stereotypical associations.

You will apply network analysis methods learned in Foundations of CSS and Network Science

## Curation and integration of sentiment lexica

### with David Garcia

Integrating data can be one of the most impactful scientific tasks when resources are scattered. 

Currently, there are many lexica of words and phrases annotated for emotion or sentiment in multiple languages. 

Including LIWC translations, adaptations of ANEW, and other multilingual resources, this project would curate and document a single-source to integrate all these lexica.

We have a preliminary incomplete list, the purpose would be to systematically fill it as in a review paper.

## Diary text and arousal

### Petar Jercic

Investigate how the sole process of writing a (digital) short-text diary affects the authors' arousal levels:
- If we consider a given situation where the authors first take the physiological measurement (ECG sensor), and afterward write a short-text diary entry: the sole process of writing should lower the authors' initial arousal levels.
- Hypothesis: There is a higher (physiological) arousal measured during the ECG sensor measurement, and a lower (sentiment) arousal measured during the writing of the text.
- Method: Because there is no absolute arousal scale between physiological measurement and sentiment arousal (two different arousal scales), we should first build up a baseline over time of these two data sets, and compare the deviations from that baseline between the physiology and text sentiment.

## Dutch physiological macroscope 

### with Petar Jercic
Investigate how the nationwide (Dutch) event timeline affects the national arousal and mood, measured through physiological recording (ECG sensor), subjective mood rating, context questionnaire, and short-text diary (focus on pre/post COVID19).
- If we are able to recreate a nationwide (Dutch) event timeline, and if we consider a given situation where the individuals daily take the physiological measurement (ECG sensor), and afterward write a short-text diary entry: the nationwide (Dutch) events should be reflected in the individuals' arousal levels.
- Method: recreate a nationwide (Dutch) event timeline and cross-correlating it with individuals' daily entries (which include short text, physiology measurement, subjective mood rating, and context information).

## Exploration and generation of children poems

### with Segun Aroyehun                                           

An exploration of a collection of poems written by children (Hipson and Mohammad, 2020)  along several dimensions such as topic, style, affect, humour and their variations across available attributes in the dataset. 

Application of findings to design prompts for an existing generative model (e.g. GPT-2) and analysis of the (perceived) quality of the machine-generated poems.

## Test cases for emotion detection systems
### with Segun Aroyehun
The evaluation of existing emotion detection systems from text has been with a focus on accuracy score on test dataset(s). This limits our understanding of their capabilities and tendencies.

An alternative is to examine model behaviour on test cases (Ribeiro et al., 2020). The goal of this project is to create test cases and use them for the evaluation of existing emotion detection systems.

## A psycholinguistic analysis of parliamentary records
### with Segun Aroyehun

Recent research has shown that the complexity of language use by politicians differs across the political spectrum (Schoonvelde et al., 2019). 

- Beyond linguistic complexity, what other psycholinguistic variations exist in the language use of political elites? 
- What is the trend over time? 
- What are the potential explanations for the observed differences?  

This project will examine a number of psycholinguistic properties of parliamentary speeches over time including emotions, moral language, analytical tone, and style using suitable lexical resources.
