## Challenges in individual emotion detection

**The problem of sentiment analysis: Writer versus reader emotions**

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=950, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/communication.png")
```

Current sentiment analysis approaches assume that the **ground truth** is an annotation of emotions by **a reader**, often a student or a crowdsourcing worker

# LEIA vs other methods: $F_1$ scores

| Test | TF-IDF SVM | FastText  | LEIA |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Random | $53.3 [53.2, 53.4]$ | $62.5  [62.4, 62.6]$ | $\textbf{70.8 [70.7, 70.9]}$ |
| Users | $53.3 [53.2, 53.4]$ | $60.6 [60.5, 60.7]$ | $\textbf{69.0 [68.9, 69.0]}$|
| Time | $54.7 [54.6, 54.8]$ | $61.6 [61.5, 61.7]$ | $\textbf{69.7 [69.6, 69.8]}$ |

- LEIA outperforms typical text modelling approaches in all three tests
- $F_1$ scores very slightly lower in user and time test versus random test
- Performance mostly homogeneous across emotions

| Anger | Fear | Affection | Happiness | Sadness |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $\small 71.6 [71.4, 71.7]$ | $\small 67.8 [67.6, 68.0]$ |  $\small 73.0 [72.8, 73.1]$ | $\small  72.5 [72.3, 72.7]$ | $\small  70.3 [70.1, 70.4]$ |

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Affection  | **70.5  [64.2, 76.8]** |  41.0 [36.0, 46.2] | 53.5  [46.6, 60.5] |
| Anger | **68.0 [61.3, 74.4]** | 40.0  [34.7, 45.3]  |  34.4 [28.0, 41.1] |
| Fear | **65.5 [58.7, 72.0]** | 33.1 [28.3, 38.0] | 41.5  [34.7, 48.3] |
| Happiness  | **81.1 [75.3, 86.2]** | 63.2  [57.7, 68.5] | 65.5 [58.8, 72.1] |
| Sadness | **65.0 [58.3, 71.5]** | 49.0 [43.7, 54.1] | 47.0  [40.0, 53.9] |
| Average | **70.0 [67.2, 72.8]** | 45.2 [42.9, 47.6] | 48.4  [45.3, 51.5] |

- Amazon Mechanical Turk annotators recruited with </br>high approval rate in the US (pay ~ 11$/h)
- McNemar test of LEIA vs majority vote ( $\chi^2=74$, p<0.001)
- **Follow up:** testing versus native-speaking psychology students

# Transfer evaluation with ISEAR task

- International Survey on Emotion Antecedents and Reactions
- Developed to measure *emotion recognition ability* 
- Fear example: *"When I was involved in a traffic accident"*
- Joy example: *"When I got a letter offering me the Summer job that I had applied for"*
- **Follow up:** get own annotator values of $F_1$ for ISEAR

LEIA $F_1$ versus ISEAR emotion labels:

| Joy | Fear | Anger | Sadness |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $86.3[82.0, 89.8]$ | $76.2[71.4, 80.5]$ | $77.4 [73.0, 81.4]$ | $73.2[68.1, 77.6]$ |

** Superhuman Artificial Affective Intelligence: Initial results suggest that LEIA outperforms humans in emotion detection from social media text **

# Summary

- **Computational Social Science**
  - Analyzing human behavior and socio-technical phenomena with digital trace data and computational methods
  - Need for focus on methods validation and comparison
  
  
- **Social Media Macroscopes of Emotions**
  - Macroscopes of emotions in the UK agree with survey data
  - Replication in Austria in Der Standard


- **Detecting Individual Emotions from Social Media Text**
